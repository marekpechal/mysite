I did my PhD in Switzerland at ETH Zurich where I worked on quantum optical experiments with superconducting circuits. Since November 2016, I have been working as a postdoc in the [laboratory for integrated nano-quantum systems](http://www.stanford.edu/~safavi) at Stanford under a fellowship of the Swiss National Science Foundation. Here I am currently studying nonlinear and parametric processes which could be used to convert microwave photons to millimeter waves for quantum information transfer.
