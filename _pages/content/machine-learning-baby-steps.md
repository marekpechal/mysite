To get the Atari environments working under Windows, one needs to do a bit of prep work. Fortunately, it is quite nicely explained in the `readme` file of `https://github.com/j8lp/atari-py`. After following the instructions, I still had some problem with the `libstdc++-6.dll` library but simply replacing the version in `C:\Users\...\Anaconda2\scripts\` by a copy of the file from `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin\` fixed it.
